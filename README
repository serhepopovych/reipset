Re-configure ip sets by applying delta changes
==============================================

Create sets with given parameters in template files if no sets already
exist and populate them with data stored locally (default) or fetched
from remote directories using rsync(1) (off by default) or from both
locations.

Only differences are applied by adding/deleting set elements that are
present/missing in new version of set data.

In case of failure previous version of ip set rules reloaded using
system service management facilities.

It is possible to pull for changes periodically with crontab(1) file
provided in /etc/cron.d/reipset that runs /netctl/bin/reipset
periodically.
